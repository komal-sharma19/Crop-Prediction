# Crop Prediction System
A powerful and interactive web application built using Flask and Machine Learning that allows farmers and agricultural professionals to predict the most suitable crop based on soil composition and environmental factors. The system analyzes input parameters to recommend optimal crops for specific growing conditions.

# Features
🧪 Input essential soil nutrients (N, P, K) and environmental parameters
🌡️ Consider climate factors like temperature, humidity, and rainfall
📊 Process data through trained machine learning model
🌾 Receive instant crop recommendations based on conditions
📱 User-friendly interface accessible on any device
🔄 Real-time prediction with immediate results
📈 High accuracy prediction based on agricultural datasets

# How It Works

## Users input soil and environmental parameters:

Nitrogen content

Phosphorus content

Potassium content

Temperature

Humidity

pH level

Rainfall

The model processes these inputs using machine learning algorithms
The system recommends the most suitable crop for the given conditions

# Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-prediction-system.git
cd crop-prediction-system

# Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application:
python app.py

Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000
Enter the required parameters and click "Predict"

# Notes:

Ensure all input values are within realistic agricultural ranges
The model is trained on specific regional crop data
For best results, provide accurate soil test results and meteorological data
